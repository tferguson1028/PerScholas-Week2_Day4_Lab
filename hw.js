// 3.   Write a function that takes bill amount and item price and says how many quarters they'd get in return


//4.    Write a function that prints out how many bills you would recieve in change after paying a certain amount.  Return in as large denominations as possible. Parameters should be amount paind and amount cost

// 5.   Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100 with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
